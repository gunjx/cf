      <h3 class="h3">More About Me</h3>
      <p>
        I have completed my studies in business administration early 2016. Sine then I have worked as a research assistant as well as a freelancer. I've completed a bunch of marketing and online marketing projects both during my studies as well as therafter. I am mostly self-taught and try to always incorporate the lates developments in content creation and advertising.
      </p>
      <p>
        As of late I've been expanding into the realms of web development. For search engine optimization it was always important for me to have a basic understanding of HTML/CSS. However, I was lacking the ability to independently create and deploy landing pages. Within a total of six months I have now achieved enough understanding of both frontend and backend technologies up to a point where I can create full fledged web apps in Python/Flask and Ruby/Rails.
      </p>
      <p>
        Besides working I like travelling and reading about science and philisophy. I enjoy playing any kind of card and board games. In my free time I follow the latest developments in the German startup scene as well as trends in AI, cryptocurrency and science in general.
